# Sign Language Detector

This project aims to create a real-time sign language detector that can translate sign language into English or Hindi. The application will use a camera to capture hand gestures, process them using a deep learning model, and display the translated text on the screen. It will also include a text-to-speech feature to speak the translation live.
